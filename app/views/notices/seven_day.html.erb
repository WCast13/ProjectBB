<p>Re:  Notice of Rule Violations/Haven Lake Estates and Violation of Chapter 723.061</p><br>

<p> Dear (Residenets Name):</p><br>

<p>
  You are in violation of the Rules & Regulations of Haven Lake Estates with respect to your tenancy, to wit:
</p><br>
<br>

<p>
  Ruby- Rule Number, Name and Body
</p><br>

<p> You are in violation of the above Rules and Regulations and the Park Management has recently become aware that:</p><br>
<br>

<p>Unordered List- Ruby- Rule Summary</p><br>
<br>

<p>In order to bring your tenancy into conformity with the Rules & Regulations of Haven Lake Estates, you must: </p>

<p>Ruby- Rule Recomondation</p><br>
<br>

<p> Pursuant to Florida Statute 723.061, you have seven (7) days from the delivery of this Notice within which to bring your homesite into compliance with the Rules and Regulations of Haven Lake Estates.  Delivery of the mailed notice shall be deemed given five (5) days after the date of postmark.
</p><br>
<br>

<p>
  If you fail and/or refuse to comply with this notice within seven (7) days from the delivery, as defined above, your tenancy will be terminated.  Should you thereafter fail and/or refuse to remove your home from the premises, eviction proceedings will be filed against you, seeking not only your removal from Haven Lake Estates, but also court costs, attorney's fees, and any other relief a court may deem just and proper.
</p><br>
<br>

<p>
  A second violation of a properly promulgated rule or regulation or of Florida Statute, Chapter 723 within 12 months of the first violation is unequivocally a ground for eviction, and it is not a defense to any eviction proceeding that a violation has been cured after the second violation.
</p>


<p>PLEASE GOVERN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY.</p><br>
<p>Sincerely,</p><br>
<br>
